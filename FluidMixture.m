function [Kf,RHOf]=FluidMixture(Kw,Ko,Kg,RHOw,RHOo,RHOg,Sw,So,Sg)% Written by Jack Dvorkin 08/22/2024F% Kf and RHOf are the bulk modulus and density of the immiscible% water/oil/gas system% Kw, Ko, Kg are the bulk moduli of the water, oil, and gas% RHOw, RHOo, RHOg are the densities of the water, oil, and gas% Sw, So, Sg are the satuartions of water, oil, and gas; they have to add% up to 1:  Sw+So+Sg=1% Balancing saturationSo=1-Sw-Sg;Kf=1./(Sw./Kw+So./Ko+Sg./Kg);RHOf=Sw.*RHOw+So.*RHOo+Sg.*RHOg;
