function [M,G,K,Ip,Is,PR]=Velocity2Moduli(Vp,Vs,RHO);% Written by Jack Dvorkin 08/22/2024% K is for the bulk modulus; G is for the shear modulud; M is for the compressional modulus; RHO is for% density; Ip is for the P-wave impedance; Is is for the S-wave impedance;% PR is for Poisson's ratio.M=Vp.*Vp.*RHO; G=Vs.*Vs.*RHO; K=M-(4/3)*G;Ip=Vp.*RHO; Is=Vs.*RHO; PR=0.5*(M./G-2)./(M./G-1);
